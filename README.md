## ðŸ“š Getting Started in Minutes

Embark on your Bolter journey with these simple steps:

1. Add the `bolter` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  bolter:
```

2. Import the `bolter` package in your Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:bolter/bolter.dart';
```

3. Define your custom presenter classes that extend `Presenter`:
```dart
class CounterPresenter extends Presenter<CounterPresenter> {
  int _counter = 0;

  int get counter => _counter;

  void incrementCounter() {
    perform(action: () => _counter++);
  }
}
```

4. Inject your presenter classes using `PresenterProvider`:

```dart
PresenterProvider<CounterPresenter>(
  presenter: CounterPresenter(),
  child: MyHomePage(),
)
```

5. Access the presenter and manage state within your widgets using the extension method:

```dart
final presenter = context.presenter<CounterPresenter>();
```

6. Use `BolterBuilder` to rebuild widgets in response to state changes:

```dart
BolterBuilder<int>(
  getter: () => presenter.counter,
  builder: (context, counter) => Text(
    '$counter',
    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
  ),
)
```

With just a few lines of code, Bolter is ready to efficiently manage your app's state. Now you can enjoy automatic updates without the need for manually switching from one presenter to another!
